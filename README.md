# BMI-calculator
One of the simplest programs to start C programming
Description:
This C program demonstrates the use of fundamental programming constructs such as functions, loops, and conditional statements. It starts by defining the main function, which serves as the entry point of the program. Inside the main function, it declares variables for weight, height, and BMI. It then prompts the user to input their weight and height using the scanf function.

Next, it calculates the BMI using the provided weight and height and prints the calculated BMI along with the user's input. It utilizes a simple if-else conditional structure to determine whether the calculated BMI falls into the underweight, overweight, or normal range, providing appropriate messages accordingly. The if statements enable the program to display personalized feedback based on the BMI value.

In summary, this program showcases the use of input/output functions, arithmetic operations, conditional statements (if-else), and user interaction to calculate and categorize BMI, making it an illustrative example for learning the basics of C programming.
